# Asset Selector Properties

You can use the Asset Selector properties to customize the way the Asset Selector is rendered. The following table lists the properties that you can use to customize and leverage the Asset Selector.

For example given the following path, `/content/dam/marketing/subfolder/`, Asset Selector will not allow you to traverse through any parent folder, but will only display the children folders.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

An array of objects is required that contains an id property of the assets. For example, `[{id: 'urn:234}, {id: 'urn:555'}]` An asset must be available in the current directory. If you need to use a different directory, provide a value for the `path` property as well.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

Passing a value through this interface will override the default translations provided and instead use your own.  In order to perform the override, you must pass a valid [Message Descriptor](https://formatjs.io/docs/react-intl/api/#message-descriptor) object to the key of `i18nSymbols` that you want to override.                                                                                                                              |

You can select the translation language by providing a valid locale string through the `intl.locale` prop. For example: `intl={{ locale: "es-es" }}` </br></br> The locale strings supported follow the [ISO 639 - Codes](https://www.iso.org/iso-639-language-codes.html) for the representation of names of languages standards. </br></br> List of supported locales: English - 'en-us' (default) Spanish - 'es-es' German - 'de-de' French - 'fr-fr' Italian - 'it-it' Japanese - 'ja-jp' Korean - 'ko-kr' Portuguese - 'pt-br' Chinese (Traditional) - 'zh-cn' Chinese (Taiwan) - 'zh-tw' |
