# Angular

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.2.7.

## Pre-requisites

:warning: This repository is intended to serve as a supplemental documentation describing the available APIs and usage examples for integrating Assets Selectors. Before attempting to install or use the Assets Selectors, ensure that your organization has been provisioned to access the Assets Selectors as part of the AEM Assets as a Cloud Service (CS) profile. If you have not been provisioned, you will not be able to successfully integrate or use these components. To request provisioning, your program admin should raise a support ticket marked as P2 from Admin Console and include the following information:

- Program ID and Environment ID for the AEM CS instance
- Domain names where the integrating application is hosted

After provisioning, your organization will be provided with an `imsClientId`, `imsScope`, and a `redirectUrl` corresponding to the environment that you request â€”which are essential for the configuration of Assets Selectors to work end-to-end. Without those valid properties, you will not be able to run this example

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
